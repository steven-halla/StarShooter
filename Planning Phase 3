I currently have 6 levels complte
level 7 is a work in progress
I need to create more sprites

Rewards
Bonus Objectives  1-3 per stage
Examples of bonus objectives
-run with a certain number of chips
- Kill all of an enemy type
- Dont let any enemies escape

Stage 8
Diffuse the bomb
stay in the Staging area, diffuse the bomb, which is on a counter
ENemies spawn fast in these areas
Leving the circle will be a penalty
this could be a bonus objective to never leave circle
Cirle will slowly move in random directions
Circle will always move UP on the Y position
Circle will slowly move in X positions
Createa  collide rect
Metal shield will be useful here

STage 9
Beat Cyclone Roy in the race
Use BUster cannon to destroy his missiles
Missiel clusters are in a pack of 8

stage 10-final for now
Escape the gravity well
Thre is a " safe path " which I will use tiled to do
If on the unsafe path ship gets dragged to right, or left side, can have two types of tiles to do this
drag left tile
drag right tile
follow the vaper trail
Targeting systems OUT no missiles
SOme times FIre will be on entire path so they will have ot soemtimes leave safety of vapor trails
Misison is to go to back enemy lines via this dangerious route and take out boss
in future HEAT Will be affected by danger zones as it eats up HEAT as controls are locked being in this zone.
